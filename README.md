# mastermind
a terminal version of the game mastermind

This project was first given to us during a pair programming workshop during my Recurse Center batch. That's a version completed by me afterwards, while on a plane with no internet access. It was an interesting exercise, not just because I couldn't look up solutions to any of the problems I ran into, but also had to decide on the more specific rules that were not explained in the task description. I was just testing the game as I was writing the code and checking what game dynamic works best. 

The rules I ended up with are slightly different than the official ones described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). The player is awarded white 'pegs' also for correctly guessing repeated colours, which in turn makes the game a bit easier to win.
